# TE3002B Intelligent Robotics Implementation

  ## Introduction
   * This course, developed by Manchester Robotics ltd. (MCR2), aims to provide students with understanding of modern autonomous systems.
   * This course is divided into ten sessions, carefully designed for the user to learn about the different aspects of robotics, from navigation techniques to advanced image recognition and Machine Learning implementation using the Puzzlebot and ROS.
   * This course will be based on challenges to make the student aware of the problems faced during the implementation of advanced intelligent algorithms in robotics.
   * This branch contains all the presentations, activities and files required for the “TE3002B Intelligent Robotics Implementation” course of the Tec de Monterrey.
   * This repository is organised by sessions, each subfolder contains all the neccesary files for each one of the activities of this course.
